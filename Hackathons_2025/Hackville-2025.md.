## Event Summary

Hackville 2025 was Sheridan’s flagship 36-hour hackathon, bringing together over 200 students from Interaction Design, Computer Science, and other disciplines to collaborate on innovative software solutions. What made our event special was the focus on bridging designers and developers through workshops, mini-events, and networking opportunities that fostered long-lasting connections. GitHub played a central role at the hackathon as teams used it for collaboration and version control, mentors introduced best practices, and we proudly showcased GitHub as a sponsor throughout the event.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant helped us provide food, prizes, and workshops for 155 attendees, creating a more inclusive and beginner-friendly environment. This support gave many first-time hackers the confidence to complete and submit their projects.

## Top Projects
The 1st place project was BearTracks, an interactive 3D campus map for Sheridan built as a progressive web app. Using the Mapbox API, students can explore categorized landmarks such as study spots, offices, food places, and parking, complete with details like hours and links. The app also features AI Bruno the Bruin, a chatbot guide that helps students navigate campuses in a fun and intuitive way.<br>
The team built BearTracks with React/Vite, Express.js, Node.js, and Figma, and managed their collaboration through GitHub, where they logged over 100 commits during development. GitHub played a crucial role in their workflow, enabling smooth version control and team contributions, which was essential in delivering a highly interactive and polished final product.
